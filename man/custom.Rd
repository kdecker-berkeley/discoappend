\title{Create custom output columns for a discovery engine definition}
\usage{
custom(report, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{report}{Either a disco engine definition, or a partial report created
by appending one or more chunks to a disco engine definition}

\item{...}{named descriptions of custom columns to add to output. Add as many
custom columns as necessary.}
}
\description{
The report chunks that are listed in \code{\link{show_chunks}} provide
high-level summarized views of entities, useful for quick spot-checking and
basic ad-hoc reporting. In contrast, custom chunks are report chunks that
are shaped by user-provided parameters (for instance, instead of getting
lifetime giving summaries, you might want summarized giving for each of the
past few years). See examples below.
}
\section{Note}{

All column names will be converted to lowercase. It is suggested you use
lowercase when naming your custom columns to avoid confusion.
}

\examples{
wealthy = has_capacity(1)

## lifetime giving summarized by area
wealthy \%>\%
  custom(business_giving = giving_to_area(business),
         athletics_giving = giving_to_area(athletics))

## use "flags" to create Yes/No columns. any disco engine definition
## can be used to create a flag:
environmental_interest = has_interest(environment)
wealthy \%>\%
  custom(environmnetalist = flag(environmental_interest))

\code{\link{flag}}
